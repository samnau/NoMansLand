Molly: Whoa a dead guy!
Molly: Coooooooool.
Molly: And look at that staff!
<<collectStaff>>
King: Ooooooooooo...
King: Whooooo...
Molly: Yikes! A ghost!
King: Er. Um.
King: Greetingsâ€¦young lady.
Molly: (trembles)
<<triggerCrouch>>
King: Do not be alarmed! 
King: I mean you no harm.
King: May I ask, how in the world did you get into the castle?
<<triggerStand>>
Molly: Um. Through the front door, actually.
<<switchExpression King shocked>>
King: That is not possible!
Molly: Well there were also a bunch of glowing lines and a giant windstorm...
King: Astounding!
Molly: Listen, do you know what part of town this is?
Molly: I am completely lost.
King: It cannot be.
<<switchExpression King confused>>
Molly: Hey, old ghost guy, I really need some help. I have zero phone reception here.
Molly: I don't recognize ANYTHING around here.
<<switchExpression Molly frown>>
King: "Old ghost guy?"
King: Young lady, I am the King of Verdania!
<<switchExpression King angry>>
Molly: Verdania? How far is that from West Groves?
King: West..Groves?
King: I have never heard of such a place.
Molly: Never heard of West Groves??
<<switchExpression Molly shocked>>
Molly: Where the heck am I??
<<switchExpression Molly frown>>
King: Excuse my poor manners.
King: May I ask your name, my dear?
Molly: Molly. My name is Molly.
King: Pleasure to meet you, fair Molly.
King: I am King Alaster the 1st, of the kingdom of Verdania.
Molly: Why do you keep saying "kingdom"?
<<switchExpression Molly confused>>
Molly: There's nothing around West Groves like that.
Molly: But then, there's no weird magical castles either.
Molly: At least I think there isn't.
King: I think I may be able to explain a few things.
King: But I feel that you have likely been through a trying day.
King; And it seems that the hour is getting late.
King: I know it may sound odd...
King: But I think it best that you sleep here tonight.
King: It is not safe outside these walls.
Molly: But my parents will freak out!
<<switchExpression Molly shocked>>
Molly: I have to get home!
King: Inconceivable. I have a strong indication that returning you to your home is out of the question.
King: For the moment, least.
<<switchExpression Molly crying>>
Molly: How did this happen?
Molly: Mom will be flipping out!
Molly: I just wanna go home...
King: There, there.
King: I know it comes as a shock, but I will explain what I can tomorrow morning.
King: I promise you will be safe within these walls.
King: You have my word.
