          It was just an ordinary day after school. A terrible day, but otherwise ordinary. Till Molly was chased into the park near her house by her worst enemy Meena. Apparently she wasn't done tormenting her for the day.
          And as she was running to get away from Meena, she tripped. Molly had no idea such a small mistake would result in such huge consequences. The next thing she knew, she was still in the woods, but they were not the same
          woods she had been running through a moment ago. And they were so quiet. Not even a bird chirp to be heard. Only the wind blowing through the trees. Where was she?
