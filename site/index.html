          It was just an ordinary day after school. A terrible day, but otherwise ordinary. Until Meena decided she wasn't done ruining Molly's day and chased her into a park on the way home from school.
          And as she was running to get away from Meena, Molly stopped to catch her breath. In a panic, she wished she could vanish. The next thing she knew, she was falling. But when she landed, she was still in the woods, but they were not the same
          woods she had been running through a moment ago. And they were so quiet. Not even a bird chirp to be heard. Only the wind blowing through the trees. Where was she?
