attack sequence:

    public bool isDead = false; <-- might be redundant and also is probably the realm of the health tracker
    bool isDamaged = false; <-- seems redundant, tracking success or failure of counters should be enough

    bool battleChallengeActive = false; <-- probably belongs to the battle controller
    [HideInInspector] public int attcackCount = 0;
    [HideInInspector] public int defenseCount = 0;

    [SerializeField] GameObject battleUI; <-- unsure if I need this in the monster
    public List<BattleCombo> defenseCombos;
    public bool canDefend = false;
    [HideInInspector] public int defenseComboIndex = 0; <-- redundant, defenseCount should be fine
    bool hasRequiredFamiliar = false;
    public List<BattleCombo> counterCombos;
    List<KeyCode> pressedKeys = new List<KeyCode>();
    int counterComboIndex = 0; <-- redundant but the attackCount name doesn't match up with the counterCombo index purpose
    float comboInterval = 2f; <-- may not be needed
    int comboMatchCount = 0; <-- has a purpose, needs a better name
