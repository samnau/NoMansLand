attack sequence:

    public bool isDead = false; <-- might be redundant and also is probably the realm of the health tracker
    bool isDamaged = false; <-- seems redundant, tracking success or failure of counters should be enough
    public bool defenseSuccess = false; <-- should this be an event instead?
    bool battleChallengeActive = false; <-- probably belongs to the battle controller
    [HideInInspector] public int attcackCount = 0;
    [HideInInspector] public int defenseCount = 0;
    [SerializeField] GameObject hero; <-- unsure if I need this in the monster
    [SerializeField] GameObject battleUI; <-- unsure if I need this in the monster
    public List<BattleCombo> defenseCombos;
    public bool canDefend = false;
    [HideInInspector] public int defenseComboIndex = 0; <-- redundant, defenseCount should be fine
    bool hasRequiredFamiliar = false;
    public List<BattleCombo> counterCombos;
    List<KeyCode> pressedKeys = new List<KeyCode>();
    int counterComboIndex = 0; <-- redundant but the attackCount name doesn't match up with the counterCombo index purpose
    float comboInterval = 2f; <-- may not be needed
    int comboMatchCount = 0; <-- has a purpose, needs a better name
    [SerializeField] GameEvent takeDamage;
    [SerializeField] GameEvent dealDamage;
    [SerializeField] GameEvent startAttack;
    [SerializeField] GameEvent startDefense;

    public enum Familiars
    { frog, bear, raven, dragon }

    public Familiars requiredFamiliar;

    public enum Runes
    { power, speed, magic, harmony }

    public Runes requiredRune;

    bool hasRequiredRune = false;
    [SerializeField] GameObject familiar;


order:

- all intro animation plays
- monster starts attack
- monster collider hits familiar
- defense boolean set to true
- user input can be evaluated as long as defense is enabled
- combo interval reset check for success? I need it to happen within a time, I don't want to check the time in 2 places. method name doesn't cover the success check, but where else could I check success after time interval?
	- no extra interval check. the end of the attack will trigger the check
- fire counter start event on defense success
- trigger hero counter announcement
- set canCounter bool to true
- listen for counter combo input
