<<SetSpeaker Molly surprise smirk>>
Man, time flies when you're at the library!
<<SetSpeaker Molly idle smile>>
(A frog hopps onto the sidewalk)
<<SetSpeaker Molly surprise smile>>
Oh, hello there, little froggy.
<<SetSpeaker Molly idle frown>>
Are you having a bad day too?
<<SetSpeaker Molly idle smirk>>
Or are you just looking for a friend?
(A voice calls out from behind Molly)
<<SetSpeaker Meena surprise frown>>
There you are, you little freak!
<<SetSpeaker Molly surprise surprise>>
Oh, no, Meena!!

You can't run forever, loser!
Why won't she just leave me alone??
What to do? What to do?
