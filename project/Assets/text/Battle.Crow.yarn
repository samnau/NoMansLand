What the heck is that thing??
Is it dead?
<<SetExpression surprise frown>>
Ummmâ€¦ I think it just moved.
<<SetExpression surprise frown>>
<<SetSpeakerName King's-Ghost>>
It is an unfamiliar, to be certain. We must face it head on.
<<SetExpression idle annoyed>>
<<SetSpeakerName Molly>>
Do I really have to fight this thing?
<<SetSpeakerName King's-Ghost>>
Unfortunately, you must. Be brave, child.

<<SetSpeakerName Molly>>
And how exactly do I fight it?
<<SetSpeakerName King's-Ghost>>
Unfamiliars may only be defeated by the appropriate familiar.
<<SetExpression surprise frown>>
<<SetSpeakerName Molly>>
But all I have is this frog!
<<SetSpeakerName King's-Ghost>>
Then let us hope it is the familiar we need.
<<SetExpression surprise annoyed>>
<<SetSpeakerName Molly>>
